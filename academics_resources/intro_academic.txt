My career path hasn't been what you'd call conventional. Around 4th year of secondary school, I developed an interest for accounting, with business and maths being my strongest subjects during the junior certificate. I ultimately took Accounting, Business Studies and Economics for my Leaving Certificate, with Accounting and Economics being my absolute favourites. 

My aspirations were to secure a place in DT366, a level 8 Accounting and Finance degree at Dublin Institute of Technology (or Technical University Dublin). I needed 455 points to be admitted, but I completely surpassed that gaol and achieved 544 points. 

I accepted to the Bachelors in Commence at Univeristy College where I graduated with a 1:1, primarilty taking modules in accounting, economics, and machine learning. These grades earned me the Stage 1 & 2 schoolarships, and, had I have gone on to complete the professional accounting exams, I would have the maximum number of exemptions possible, and managed to secure a spot on the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu summer internship program.

Despite this success, I realised after the internship accounting wasn't eactly what I wanted out of my career. Much of what I loved about accounting, the double entry bookkeeping and record keeping, had been automated away by software. I realised my calling was in developing these very kind of systems.
