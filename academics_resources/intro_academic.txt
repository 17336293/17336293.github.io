My career path hasn't been what you'd call conventional. Around 4th year of secondary school, I developed an interest for accounting, with business and maths being my strongest subjects during the junior certificate. I ultimately took Accounting, Business Studies and Economics for my leaving certificate, with Accounting and Economics being my absolute favourites.
